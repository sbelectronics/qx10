List of images

NOTE: The IMD and HFE files are untested. I made them by loading the IMG file
into HXCFloppyEmulator using the custom format hybridfmt.xml, and then
exporting to IMD or HFE. I don't seem to own a properly aligned Epson drive
to test the IMD file on; In my setup I use a Gotek.

NOTE2: I had bad luck with FlashFloppy and HFE files. If you are using
FlashFloppy, then I suggest using the custom IMG.CFG file in the 
../flashfloppy/ directory together with the IMG file.
